	<h2>The environment we live in will
        change dramatically in the next
        50 years.</h2>
<img id="image2" src="img/image4.jfif" width="20%">
    Our environment is closely connected with society. This is like a chain: if we destroy
    the ecosystem, we couldn't live longer. In my opinion our community every day destroys planet.
    Nowadays there are two main ways of destruction: 
<br><br>
<img id="image3" src="img/image5.jfif" width="20%">
    The first thing is the nature destruction. We are mining resources for jewerly, technologies, etc.
    But these resourses aren't unlimited and amount of them extremely decreasing. The next 50 years we will
    have low percentage of resources we have now on my opinion. 
<br><br>
    The second aspect is water and air pollution. For example, many cars emit exhaust fumes, and factories 
    also use chemicals which harm the earth's air system. In addition, water is also affected by trash and 
    things like food waste, which can cause the fish in lakes, rivers and seas to die. As a result, people 
    can not breathe fresh air or drink enough water, and sometimes they will need other facilities to make 
    oxygen and purify the water.
<br><br>
<img id="image2" src="img/image6.jfif" width="25%">
    But I think that's not a problem because nowadays we are closer to make alternative energy, which
    resolves problem about air pollution and some resouces mining. We began use electric autos which can work on
    alternative energy and don't emit exhaust, use components, which don't need to mine components, recycling trash
    to avoid the water pollution and make reusable products.
<br><br>
<img id="image3" src="img/image7.jfif" width="25%">
    So, I think our planet will be save at least 100 years because we have such a good progress in alternative 
    technologies and taking care about our environment which slowly getting better to live nowadays.
